# legacy2openapi-spec - Legacy to OpenAPI spec conversions of APIs for easy SDK code generations

OpenAPI spec-compliant APIs have the below advantages:
1. Can generate SDK codes automatically using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)
2. Can generate API playground & documentation using [openapi-ui](https://github.com/dhcode/openapi-ui) and [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)
3. Can generate nice-looking documentation using [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)

But, few SaaS companies don't offer OpenAPI spec for their own reasons. This project is an attempt to identify those legacy API documentation and convert them into OpenAPI spec.
